By following your dreams you will come to know that failure is part of the success.
It is not always that bad and it is part of the process. You need to fall before you can stand up again!
Like the universe, your dreams have no limits. You are the creator of your dreams, big or small ones.
When you understand this you are able to design a way to favor your plan and accomplish your end goal.
Life is too short to waste it with regrets. At the end of the line what we end up regretting are the things we did not get to do.
So while being young, go after what you want. Pursue your dreams.
It is in living your dreams that you get to know the true meaning of life.
